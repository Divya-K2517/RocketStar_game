Welcome to the Rocket Star Game!

This game was made using Python and VS code. It features a user-controlled rocket that moves right and left with the arrow keys. 
The objective is to catch as many randomly spwaning stars as possible. Keep track of your score with the score board in the top left.
With every star you catch, the next star's velocity increases incrementaly, making the game more difficult as time goes on. Have fun!
